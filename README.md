# University of London - Final Project Submission.

This is the repository for my final project submission to the University of London. 
I have attached the Jupyter Notebook as well as the exported HTML output. 
The Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code to run my Fake News Detection engine successfully.
The HTML output will show the results from me running the Jupyter Notebook.
