# University of London - Final Project Submission

This is the repository for my final project submission to the University of London. <br>
I have attached the Jupyter Notebook as well as the exported HTML output.  <br>
The Jupyter Notebook [Final Project.ipynb](https://github.com/simonmurrell1979/finalproject/blob/main/Final%20Project.ipynb) contains the Python code to run my Fake News Detection engine successfully. <br>
The HTML output [Final Project.html](https://github.com/simonmurrell1979/finalproject/blob/main/Final%20Project.html) will show the results from me running the Jupyter Notebook. <br>
